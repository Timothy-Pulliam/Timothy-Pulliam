### Hi there 👋

My name is <b>Timothy Pulliam</b>. I started my IT career as a Linux SysAdmin. Having some Python experience I began learning webframeworks such as Flask. This gave me a greater appreciation for the challenges that developers face in their daily lives. This drove me to close the gap between Dev and Ops. I realized Infrastructure as Code	&#8482; was imperative to create automated, repeatable, resilient deployments. My current focus is creating AWS architecture using IaC principles and best practices, as well as implementing CI/CD. Feel free to look around or follow me on Twitter or Linkedin.
